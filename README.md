After several years of inactivity on this project, I decided to open its source and put it on GitHub.

This game was first released on Google Play in 2012 ! It was a fully commercial product at this time. Now, I decided to open it and let it go. Fly, my little bird !

More explanations may come later...

Have fun, and best regards,

## Disclaimer

Keep in mind that it was a personnal side project, it does not have a lot of code comments, no unit tests, was not coded using the CDD methodology... 
BUT it works, ans as far as I can remember, it is complete. 

I release it under the GPLv3 license, it is free, fork it, compile it, modify it, but please, respect the GPL. This is MY game, I did everything in this except:

- the graphics were done by Fran√ßois Cochez
- the menu music comes from Apple GarageBand

## Modifications for this public release

I had to work a little on this to release it.

- I removed all the monetization stuff
- I removed the "shop" section
- All purchasable upgrades are unlocked by default (onboard camera, screenshots, structure stress indicators)
- I upgraded the code to support 64bits devices (mandatory to release it on Google Play these days)
